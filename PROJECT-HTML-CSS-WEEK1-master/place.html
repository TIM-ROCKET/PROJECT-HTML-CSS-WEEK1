            Sushi Tei is no ordinaire dining restaurant, notably we believe in providing an ethereal with an alluring ambience more than a dining experience just for you by setting ourselves apart from the norm.<br>
            We present an assortment of scrumptious and creatively designed Japanese gastronomy - appealing to the delight of aficionados of Japanese cuisine. Our menu features Japanese offerings and innovative dishes illustrating the emerging influence of Asia on modern Japanese cuisine. A revolving selection of appetizer, dinner, sushi specials guarantee a new experience with each visit to our restaurant outlets. More than often, seasonal themes sprung up to unleash the inquisitive mind of our customers with the likes of Hokkaido's promotion and more that has yet to come following the changes accordingly to Japan’s season, Salmon harvesting season, Autumn's special the coldest season, Aburi Spring season special, etc.<br>
            With also the modest and unassuming homegrown Japanese Kaiten (conveyor belt) chain, it is by no revelation that we conform to an open-kitchen concept that allows our patrons the prerogative to relish the mouth-watering savories amidst the gazing of the culinary skills of the restaurants' chefs..<br></p>
